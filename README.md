# Uploader

[By SÃ©bastien L'haire](http://sebastien.lhaire.org)

A Laravel library to provide file upload utilities. A Javascript library builds a
  complete file upload widget with upload button, drag-and-drop zone, progress bar
  and result builder. A controller is available to manage uploaded files.

It uses:

* a Javascript table builder based on [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) Javascript framework.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 5 CSS Framework.
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons

Demo site available [here](https://sebastien.lhaire.org/uploader).

## Installation

1. `composer require seblhaire/uploader`

2. Composer will automatically link the package with Laravel. But you still can explicitely add provider and facade to your `config/app.php`:
```php
  'providers' => [
    ...
      Seblhaire\TableBuilder\UploaderServiceProvider::class,
      ...
   ],
   'aliases' => [
        ...
      "TableBuilderHelper" => Seblhaire\TableBuilder\UploaderHelper::class
   ]
```

3. Publish package (optionally).
``` sh
$ php artisan vendor:publish
```


4. Set storage link (optionally, see Laravel doc)
``` sh
$ php artisan storage:link
```

5. For Javascript and stylesheets, see next section.

## Javascript and stylesheets

On a webpage, every JS library and CSS stylesheets can be linked separately. If you choose this classical way, first dowload and install above mentionned libraries. Then publish package files as explained above and put following tags in your template:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/vendor/seblhaire/uploader/upload.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" property="stylesheet" href="css/vendor/seblhaire/uploader/uploader.css"/>
```

But websites often use many libraries and stylesheets and browser must download many files before the site can be rendered properly. Modern websites come with a single compressed Javascript file which concatenates necessary scripts; same principle for stylesheets. With Laravel you can use [Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix) to compile files.

Use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager :
`npm install bootstrap jquery @fortawesome/fontawesome-free`

Then your js source file should be something like this:

```js
global.jQuery = require('jquery');
var $ = global.jQuery;
var jQuery = global.JQuery;
window.$ = $;
window.jQuery = jQuery;
require('bootstrap');
require('../../vendor/seblhaire/uploader/resources/js/uploader.js');
require('../../vendor/seblhaire/uploader/resources/js/UploadedFileContainerExt.js');
```
`UploadedFileContainerExt` is optional, since you can write your own result processor and your own file container.

For your stylesheet:

```css
@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';
@import "~@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/scss/fontawesome";
@import "~@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/scss/regular";
@import "~@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/scss/solid";
@import "~@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/scss/brands";

@import "../../vendor/seblhaire/uploader/resources/css/uploader";
```

## Configuration file

Uploader library is customizable. Default values can be changed, either in configuration file, or by passing options in Facade function (see next section). If you want to modify default configuration file, publish package files and access to `config/uploader.php`.

## Usage

Uploader package comes with a simple Facade.

Link to Facade:

`use Seblhaire\Uploader\UploaderHelper;`

### UploaderHelper::init

Inits a uploader PHP object that can be passed to the view to set the uploader properly.

`UploaderHelper::init($uploaderElement, $label, $url,  $options = array(), $additionalParams = array())`

where:

* `$uploaderElement`: id of `<div>` tag where the uploader must be inserted.

* `$additionalParams`: array of parameters to be sent to routes.

Uploader sends data to a controller (see [below](#controller)) which accepts parameters to set filename, file systems storage name and file path. Since these values are usually set dynamically, Uploader Javascript object provides methods to set them;  the PHP object built by our Facade provides methods to insert Javascript code properly, for instance in Ajax scripts.

### Get uploader

`getUploader()`

Prints javascript code to get uploader class.

### Set path name

`setPath($path, $is_string = true)`
* `$path` can be a string or a variable name
* `$is_string` indicates if `$path` is a string (`true`) or a variable (`false`).

Find further explanation [here](#controller) and usage example [here](#summary).

### Set file pattern

`setfilepattern($filename)`

 Define a pattern to build file names for uploaded files that replace original file name. Find further explanation [here](#controller) and usage example [here](#summary).

### Set file system storage name

`setstoragename($storagename)`

Uploader uses [Laravel file system](https://laravel.com/docs/master/filesystem). `$storagename` must be one of the storage names stored of your application `config/filesystems.php`.  Find further explanation [here](#controller) and usage example [here](#summary).

### Set maximum file site

`setmaxsize($size)`

Defines a maximum file size in KB.

### Set accepted file types

`setmimes($mimes)`

Accepts a string of accepted, comma-separated, file extensions.

### Set rename permission
`setrename($val)`

Defines if we rename current file if a file with same name already exists in upload directory. Accepts boolean variable or string `'true'` or `'false'`.

### Reset uploader

`reset()`

empties files list.

### Get result processor
`getresultprocessor()`

After upload success, Uploader returns a Result processor, which is a Javascript object. See details [here](#uploader_result_class). You may need to access to the result processor attached to your Uploader, for instance to add files already uploaded in previous processes. In this case, insert following in your view:


`var proc = {!! $uploader->getresultprocessor() !!};`

### Show uploader

`showall()`

Displays uploader entirely if parts or whole have been hidden.

`showuploader()`

Displays uploader button and zone if has been hidden.

### Hide uploader completely

`hideall()`

Hides uploader zone and uploader label.

`hideuploader()`

Hides uploader zone


### Toggle display

`toggleall()`

If whole uploader is visible, hide it, show it if hidden.

`toggleuploader()`

If uploader zone is visible, hide it, show it if hidden.

### Summary

To summarize, in your controller insert:

```
$uploader = UploaderHelper::init(
  'uploaderdiv',
  'Uploader',
  route('fileupload'),
  [
    'filecontainer' => 'UploadedFileContainerExt'
  ], [ // additional parameters transmitted to second script
    'article_title' => "l'ami",
    'article_id' => 40
]);
...
return view('uploader', ['uploader' => $uploader]);
```
In your blade template, insert following at the place you want your uploader to appear:

`{!! $uploader !!}`

If you need to set form parameters or add files in result list, you can use methods shown above. In this case, we insert them in document ready clause but you will generally use it in an Ajax function:
```
jQuery(document).ready(function(){
  // set uploaders after page is completely loaded
  {!! $uploader->setpath('/uploads') .
  $uploader->setstoragename('public'); !!}
  var proc = {!! $uploader4->getresultprocessor() !!}
  proc.preparedisplay({filename: 'seb.jpg', ext: 'jpg'}, 1);
});
```

## Uploader result class

File processing depends strongly on your web app purposes. Therefore it is impossible to provide a complete uploader package that satisfies all needs. We provide useful functions instead.

Uploader uses a result class to deal with upload results returned by controller. Package contains a result class `UploadresultProcessor` stored in `resources/js/upload.js` that can be replaced or extended.

Mandatory class properties and function are:
* property `uploader`. This links a result class instance to its corresponding uploader instance.
* property `filelist`. Contains uploaded files.
* method `init(uploader)`. It is called by uploader after instance creation in order to set `uploader` property.
* method `process(res)`: this function is called to process upload result. For each uploaded file, it creates a file container class instance (cf. below) and adds file to `filelist` property. If result contains an error, error is displayed in a alert `<div>`.
* method `buildresdiv(id, myclass)` builds a `<div>` to contain file list.

A file container is a class that builds a `<div>` inside the file list `<div>`. Class name is defined in uploader parameter `filecontainer`. It must have following methods:

* method `init(processor)` inits class. It links it to file processor (and therefore to uploader) and inits a property `idx` which contains file index in file procesor `filelist`.
* method `build(file, info)` constructs the `<div>` and adds info from `file` parameter. `info` contains general information, such as base url.

In `resources/js/upload.js`, you can find file container `UploadedFileContainer` which is used by default by our uploader. It builds a very simple container with basic file information. We have also added a url buiding utilty `buildurl(file, info)` which can be used in your own class extension. File url are built following these rules:

* If the file object returned by file upload route contains a parameter `url`, we return this value.
* If general information in parameter `info` contains a `baseurl` value, we build the file url with this value.
* If property `baseurl` is defined in file processor instance, we build the file url with this value.
* If option `baseurl` is defined in uploader parameters, we build the file url with this value.

In `resources/js/UploadedFileContainerExt.js` we define class `UploadedFileContainerExt` which extends `UploadedFileContainer` and builds a nice file container, with image
thumbnail and provides other functionalities, such as file url copy and file delete processor that calls route defined in uploader parameter `delurl` removing file in file result container `filelist`.

## Controller

Uploader package comes with helpers that help you build your controller methods easily. We use [Laravel file storage system](https://laravel.com/docs/master/filesystem). Files can be stored for instance in public folder to be used in website or in storage system for other purposes.

Further examples can be found [here](https://github.com/seblhaire/demoseb/blob/master/app/Http/Controllers/FileUploadController.php).


### Validation rules

We have built two Laravel validation rules that are useful for our uploader.

* `FiletypeRule` verifies that uploaded files belong to the allowed file types.
* `FilesizeRule` verifies that uploaded files size don't exceed maximum file size defined for our uploader.

`FileuploadRequest` is a custom request validation rule that verify our uploader fields. It can extended if you need to validate your additional parameters:

```
namespace App\Http\Requests;

use Seblhaire\Uploader\FileuploadRequest;

class Fileupload2Request extends FileuploadRequest
{

    public function rules()
    {
        return array_merge(parent::rules(), [
          'article_title' => "required|string",
          'article_id' => "required|numeric"
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Protected trait functions

We have defined protected methods in `UploaderTrait` that can be used in your controller as follows.

```
use Seblhaire\Uploader\UploaderTrait;

class FileUploadController extends Controller
{
  use UploaderTrait;
  ...
```

#### buildFileObj($filename)

Builds a simple `stdClass` object from file name with fields `name` and `ext`
that will be used by other functions in trait.

#### buildUniqueFileName($disk, $path, $fileobj, $separator = '-')

This function builds an unique file name in upload directory.


#### cleanFileName($filename)

Remove accentuated characters abd white spaces from file name.

#### getPath($request)

Returns file path defined from default config files or from uploader parameters.

#### getDisk($request, $path)

Return storage name either from default config files or from uploder parameters and
creates directory from path.


## Translation keys

Laravel loads config files very early in process. Therefore config files cannot contain `__('translation.key')`. In order to solve this issue, we made an helper either to print directly strings or to send translation key to translation helper. Translation keys can be delimited by character \# . Ex: `"uploader::messages.uploadtext"`. Original translations are stored under `vendor/seblhaire/uploader/resources/lang`. If you publish package files, you can find translations in `resources/lang/vendor/uploader/`.

Feel free to translate keys in your own language and either to send it to the author or to do a merge request on GitHub.
